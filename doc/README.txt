A simple to do list application for android for CMPUT 301

This application was built based on the developer tutorials that were
available on http://developer.android.com/training/index.html and also 
with the consultation of Alex Makepeace from my CMPUT 301. 

To run this application it can be imported into eclipse with the Android
SDK installed and run through an emulator or through an actual android phone.

As for the application itself there are many unimplemented features. The 
application currently takes input from the user in the form of text and 
puts it into a list below the input field. The list has the option of 
checking and unchecking the current items that are in the list. If you 
long click an item, a context menu will appear with a delete option.
This options is UNIMPLEMENTED, so clicking on the trash icon will not
delete the list item. Unfortunately the state is not maintained through
screen orientation changes, so changing orientation will lose the current
list of to do items. All other features are unimplemented.
